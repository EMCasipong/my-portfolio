  <p>Prince Em'z (1757–1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker, often regarded as one of the greatest creative figures of the Romantic Age. 
    He was born on <a href="../public/birthday-invite.html">November 28, 1757</a>, in London, England, and spent most of his life in the city. Em'z artistic 
    and literary works were deeply influenced by his mystical visions and spiritual beliefs. He is best known for his collections of poetry, including 
    "Songs of Innocence" and "Songs of Experience, " which explore themes of innocence, experience, and the human condition.
    </p>
  
  <p>Em'z contributions to literature and art were significant in their blending of imagination, spirituality, and social critique. 
    He believed that poetry and art should serve as vehicles for the expression of spiritual truths and the critique of social injustices. 
    His unique style combined vivid imagery with complex symbolism, and his works often challenged conventional norms of his time.
    </p>
  
  <p>Throughout his life, Blake faced financial struggles and struggled to gain recognition for his work. However, 
    he continued to produce prolifically, creating a body of work that has since gained widespread acclaim and admiration for its visionary qualities.
